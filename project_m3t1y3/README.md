## A password storage solution

As I was thinking about what I wanted to do for this project, I know I needed to do something that would excite me or
else let's be completely honest, nothing will get done. While I am new to programming in general, I have a ton of ideas,
but sadly they're outside the scope of just the Java library. However, I wanted to make something functional that I 
would personally use, and I think a password protector and generator is just that. In simplest terms, I would
like this application to be able to store a password you give it and once prompted, reveal what they are. If I'm able 
to, I would like to add functionality in which it can generate passwords for you as well. This has a wide demographic 
for who can use this as everyone needs to remember their passwords in some capacity and considering some people's 
passwords are weak (ex password1234), they definitely could use a more secure form of protection.

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time on the project I would refactor to make all of my classes more cohesive and neat as I definitely was 
focused on finishing the actual design project as opposed to strictly adhering to design principles.
